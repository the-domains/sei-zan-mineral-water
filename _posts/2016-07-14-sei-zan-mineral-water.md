Mineral waters often have significant magnesium levels and generally low nitrate levels. The calcium hardness is very variable, their interest comes from the presence of rare substances such as fluorine or trace elements. Mineral water can be classified according to their mineral contents: 

very little mineralized waters, 

calcic sulfated waters 

sodium bicarbonate waters. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8940173f-b441-4e87-8437-2b849f0a1434.jpg)
